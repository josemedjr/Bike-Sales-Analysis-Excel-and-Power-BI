## Bike Sales Analysis Excel and Power BI 

## Data 
The data is derived from a random sample of individuals and indicates whether they purchased a motorcycle. Each participant is assigned a unique ID, and additional details about them—including marital status, gender, income, and education—are also provided.

## Excel 
In Excel, I start by cleaning the data table, first by removing any duplicate entries. Next, I standardize the values in the Marital Status column, changing "M" to "Married" and "S" to "Single." Similarly, I update the Gender column by replacing "F" with "Female" and "M" with "Male." I also create a new column, "Age Brackets," categorizing ages into "Adolescents" (under 31), "Middle-Aged" (31-55), and "Old" (55+).

After cleaning and customizing the data, I generate Pivot Tables and charts to identify patterns and trends. The first Pivot Table analyzes the relationship between gender, income, and motorcycle ownership.

I then create a line chart to explore the correlation between commute duration and motorcycle ownership. Finally, I use another line chart to examine how motorcycle ownership varies across different age brackets.

Finally, I developed a dashboard to visually present the various charts I created. This dashboard features interactive sliders that allow users to filter the charts by Marital Status, Region, and Education, providing a dynamic way to analyze and explore the data.
